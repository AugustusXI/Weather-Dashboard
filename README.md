# Weather Dashboard

Description:
    A Weather Dashboard where a user can return to recent searches and see a current and 5 day forecast. 
    This required the use of two separate api calls made to the openweather API in order to get the coordinated for the city location. 
    Jquery was incredibly helpful in shortening the syntax for all my html targeting. 

    The main challenges were getting the Onecall api to take the coordinates from the other api. To get local storage to function as intended with the ability to select alternate cities and have it conduct the search again. 

    Finally formatting the page proved to be exceedingly difficult as well.
